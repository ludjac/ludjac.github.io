### 2D Multigrid

A multigrid algorithm written in C for a class at LTH during the early spring of 2014. Project was intended to be written i MATLAB, but we thought an approach in C would be more interesting.

______

### LEGO Mindstorm

Two projects with LEGO Mindstorm, creating a line follower and a sumo-robot. The mindstorm bricks where running LejOS firmware so the projects are written i JAVA.

______

### GP Super-heuristic

This is an attempt to evolve a heuristic function for a reversi-AI using Genetic programming in LISP dialect Clojure. The performace of the AI were not convincing but the project was very instructive. [PDF](./AI/GPreversi/Clojure_LISP_GP_s.pdf), [Github](https://github.com/ludjac/EDAN50-GP-Reversi)

______

### Numerical Stability

Three projects concerning highly oscillatory systems, differential algebraic equations for a multibody system and a discontinuos system. These were studied using Assimulo package for Python and the commercial tool DYMOLA. The report spans all three projects. [PDF](./APM/simulation-tools/fmnn05-simulation-tools.pdf)

______

### POS-tagger

POS tagger written in Python. Implements baseline-, noisy channel- and viterbi-tagger. Training and tagging were done on the CoNNL2009-set. The results were in the accuracy range 92%-94%. [Github](https://github.com/ludjac/EDA132-NLP)

______

### Optimization GA 

Optimization of multi-modal functions using a genetic algorithm in MATLAB. Multiple functions for crossover and selection. [Github](https://github.com/ludjac/TEK292-GA)
