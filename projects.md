### Agriculture drone <img src="/images/python.png" height="30" style="padding-top: 5px"> <img src="/images/raspberrypi.png" height="25" style="padding-top: 5px"> 

Prototyping, building and developing a drone for agricultural purposes. The project was carried out by myself
with agricultural consultation from my father. One of our goals was to attempt to detect the grey field slug at
an early stage. The project has been out on hold as of December 2015. Write up coming soon.

### GP Super-heuristic <img src="/images/clojure.png" height="30" style="padding-top: 5px">

This is an attempt to evolve a heuristic function for a reversi-AI using Genetic programming in LISP dialect Clojure. The performace of the AI were not convincing but the project was very instructive. [PDF](./AI/GPreversi/Clojure_LISP_GP_s.pdf), [Github](https://github.com/ludjac/EDAN50-GP-Reversi)

### 2D Multigrid <img src="/images/matlab.png" height="30" style="padding-top: 5px"> <img src="/images/C.png" height="40" style="padding-top: 5px">

A multigrid algorithm written in C for a class at LTH during the early spring of 2014. Project was intended to be written i MATLAB, but we thought an approach in C would be more interesting.

### LEGO Mindstorm <img src="/images/Java.png" height="40" style="padding-top: 5px">

Two projects with LEGO Mindstorm, creating a line follower and a sumo-robot. The mindstorm bricks where running LejOS firmware so the projects are written i JAVA.

### Numerical Stability <img src="/images/python.png" height="30" style="padding-top: 5px"> **DYMOLA**

Three projects concerning highly oscillatory systems, differential algebraic equations for a multibody system and a discontinuos system. These were studied using Assimulo package for Python and the commercial tool DYMOLA. The report spans all three projects. [PDF](./APM/simulation-tools/fmnn05-simulation-tools.pdf)

______

### POS-tagger <img src="/images/python.png" height="30" style="padding-top: 5px"> 

POS tagger written in Python. Implements baseline-, noisy channel- and viterbi-tagger. Training and tagging were done on the CoNNL2009-set. The results were in the accuracy range 92%-94%. [Github](https://github.com/ludjac/EDA132-NLP)

______

### Optimization GA <img src="/images/matlab.png" height="30" style="padding-top: 5px"> 

Optimization of multi-modal functions using a genetic algorithm in MATLAB. Multiple functions for crossover and selection. [Github](https://github.com/ludjac/TEK292-GA)
